Brad is an entertaining lecturer, but his lectures are a direct summary of the textbook without any extra insight. He's totally rehearsed the same lecture ""performance"" that he''s given for the last fifteen years. The guy is fake. In personal interactions with him I realized it was an act and he couldn't care less about me as an individual student
