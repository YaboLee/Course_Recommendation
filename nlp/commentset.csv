                      Really unhelpful, he writes his own textbook which he requires you to buy and comes out with a new version of his book every year, even though there are almost non-existent  changes, so you he can require students to buy new ones instead of used ones.

                      I really enjoyed Professor Hummel. He was a fair teacher in terms of laying out what was expected in his class. Lectures are very interesting. This class was a challenge, but I was in AP Chem so be prepared to work hard.

                      ""Tricky Tom"" is known for his tough exams but they are not impossible. If you don't get something that went on in lecture get help at the CLC, his office hours, or your TA's office hours. All his exams are scaled which helps a lot. Homework is worth a lot in the end so as long as you do that you shouldn't do that bad. GO TO LECTURE, handouts book>

                      Professor Hummel is actually a pretty good teacher especially one on one. Go to office hours even if you only have one question. Honestly, I don't think the material is all that difficult, but the exam questions can be unreasonably hard. You need to go to every single lecture and discussion if you want to do well in this class. Study hard.

                      Classes are interesting with experiments and jokes. Clear about what will be tested. Tests are easy as long as you are clear about the concepts (knowing why instead of only understanding the formulas and calculations). Answers questions super clearly if you go to him after class. Rated poorly only because people who don't study much suffers.

                      Thought Tom was rude and just an overall poor professor. Tom was definitely the worst professor I had during all my years at Illinois. Wouldn't recommend Tom to anyone, he's just a nightmare to say the least. I regret every moment I spent in that class. If I could go back I definitely would have taken the class with any other professor except Tom.

                      Very test heavy class, which is very unfair  considering his tests are both tricky as well as low on time.  If chemistry is a weak spot for you, try to take 101 first.  When you get to this class, make sure you take a couple hours out of your week to just revise, this class will kick your ass if you don't put in work.

                      Lots of thought provoking and interesting lectures. We didn't cover the material very frequently in class it was more discussion based and quizzes and high stakes quizzes would be completed on our own. Overall great teacher and great class.

                      The class is super easy, getting an A+ is no problem. However, if you didn't take Micro in high school or do independent studying outside of class, then you may fail to actually learn any concepts. He only reviews the most difficult examples in class, which may confuse those who don't have a strong understanding of the concepts.

                      While Professor Vazquez's ECON 102 class is the easiest class you will ever sign up for, do not expect to learn too much. His class is 100% based on attendance and completion. Nothing is graded for accuracy and therefore you should earn an automatic A+. He also gives extra credit every class so you should get over a 100% in the class.

                      Lecture is useless. Rather than building up your knowledge, Vasquez likes to choose the most convoluted, specific examples, adding unwritten context, and spending the entire lecture explaining why the majority of the class is wrong.
